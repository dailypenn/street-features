        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp very day, Yusef Anthony is forced to occupy a mangled body. Anthony is a devout Muslim. But during his daily prayers, his feet swell up, bubbling with fluid under the skin.</p>
        <p>"We make prayer five times a day, and my brothers would have to go to the store and buy me a pack of five pairs of socks," Anthony says. "After every prayer, I had to take the socks off and throw them away because they would be drenched in pus."</p>
        <p>His hands and fingernails are often bloated, making it impossible to complete everyday tasks.</p>
        <p>"My hands wound up becoming as big as eight-ounce boxing gloves," he says. "Inside of me, it's like I'm deteriorating."</p>
        <p>Anthony obtained his injuries while incarcerated at Holmesburg Prison. Holmesburg, opened by the city of Philadelphia in 1896, was designed to house those serving short sentences or awaiting trial, setting it apart from the maximum-security Eastern State Penitentiary. A solitary confinement prison, Holmesburg was cold and dark, with narrow, imposing concrete hallways and no windows. Impenetrable stone walls blocked off the facility from the neighborhood that surrounded it.</p>

      <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6">
        <p>They also kept hundreds of incarcerated men-and years of unspoken abuse-inside.</p>
        <p>Throughout his time at Holmesburg, Anthony underwent a wide array of tests that continue to affect his health, over 50 years later. Patch tests on his back left him with chloracne&#8211;a collection of lesions and cysts on the skin from chemical exposure&#8211;and pus-swollen fingers and feet. In one trial, he drank a milkshake that gave him hemorrhoids and forced him to undergo operations to repair his damaged rectum. In another test, Anthony took a hallucinogenic drug and answered mathematical questions.</p>
        <p>"When I went into Holmesburg, I was scared to death because I saw guys walking around with bandages on their heads, bandages on their backs, on their arms," Anthony says. "I said, 'Wow, this place is more violent than what I had heard about!'"</p>
        <p>But while Anthony initially thought prison fights were responsible for the bandages, he would soon discover the true cause: Doctor Albert Kligman and the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

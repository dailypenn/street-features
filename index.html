        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp very day, Yusef Anthony is forced to occupy a mangled body. Anthony is a devout Muslim. But during his daily prayers, his feet swell up, bubbling with fluid under the skin.</p>
        <p>"We make prayer five times a day, and my brothers would have to go to the store and buy me a pack of five pairs of socks," Anthony says. "After every prayer, I had to take the socks off and throw them away because they would be drenched in pus."</p>
        <p>His hands and fingernails are often bloated, making it impossible to complete everyday tasks.</p>
        <p>"My hands wound up becoming as big as eight-ounce boxing gloves," he says. "Inside of me, it's like I'm deteriorating."</p>
        <p>Anthony obtained his injuries while incarcerated at Holmesburg Prison. Holmesburg, opened by the city of Philadelphia in 1896, was designed to house those serving short sentences or awaiting trial, setting it apart from the maximum-security Eastern State Penitentiary. A solitary confinement prison, Holmesburg was cold and dark, with narrow, imposing concrete hallways and no windows. Impenetrable stone walls blocked off the facility from the neighborhood that surrounded it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 minus-half-col">
        <p>They also kept hundreds of incarcerated men-and years of unspoken abuse-inside.</p>
        <p>Throughout his time at Holmesburg, Anthony underwent a wide array of tests that continue to affect his health, over 50 years later. Patch tests on his back left him with chloracne&#8211;a collection of lesions and cysts on the skin from chemical exposure&#8211;and pus-swollen fingers and feet. In one trial, he drank a milkshake that gave him hemorrhoids and forced him to undergo operations to repair his damaged rectum. In another test, Anthony took a hallucinogenic drug and answered mathematical questions.</p>
        <p>"When I went into Holmesburg, I was scared to death because I saw guys walking around with bandages on their heads, bandages on their backs, on their arms," Anthony says. "I said, 'Wow, this place is more violent than what I had heard about!'"</p>
        <p>But while Anthony initially thought prison fights were responsible for the bandages, he would soon discover the true cause: Doctor Albert Kligman and the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">
          <p>Albert Montgomery Kligman (GR ‘42 M ‘47 RES ‘51) was born to Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia in March 1916. Intelligent from a young age, Kligman received a bachelor’s degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1939, followed by his doctoral degree from Penn in 1942 and a medical degree in 1949. As a medical researcher at Penn, Kligman was renowned. In the mid–1960s, he discovered that tretinoin, a derivative of vitamin A, could be used on skin to treat acne. In 1967, Kligman and Johnson & Johnson patented the drug for commercial use as Retin–A. The drug was an instant and lasting hit. Nearly 30 years after its patent, Retin–A’s sales continued to remain “steadily in the range of $100 million a year.”</p> 
          <p>As a researcher, Kligman’s accomplishments “are really unparalleled in the field,” says Jules Lipoff, assistant professor of clinical dermatology and physician at Penn Medicine. “He really helped medicalize and add scientific legitimacy to a field that did not have a whole lot of basic science to quantify and qualify it.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">
          <p>Over his career, due in large part to Retin–A’s commercial success, Kligman donated millions of dollars to the University, helping to grow its now well–established dermatology department. He was one of the most successful doctors to practice at Penn, bringing in media attention, major contracts and grants, and drug royalties.</p>
          <p>Not only was the medical community enamored with Kligman’s dermatological accolades, but many were also drawn in by his eclectic personality. Jim Ackerman (D ‘60), whose brother worked with Kligman at Holmesburg, and who vacationed with Kligman and his wife, describes him as cunning and personable. “Some people tend to lie in a more convincing way than other people can tell the truth. Kligman was one of these people,” Jim says. “A real charmer and a bit of a conman.”</p>
          <p>However, Kligman’s charisma and nonchalance made him more than just a hospitable party host. They helped him to evade criticism—and sometimes even the truth.</p>

          <p>Starting in the early 1950s, backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants, Kligman and the University of Pennsylvania began to test numerous chemicals on the bodies of incarcerated people at Holmesburg.</p>
          <p>In 1966, Kligman and Penn entered a $10,000 contract with Dow Chemical, a major chemical corporation, to test dioxin, a highly poisonous component of Agent Orange and other herbicides. Dow wanted to find the minimum amount of dioxin required to elicit a reaction in human subjects. In the tests, Dow instructed Kligman to apply small doses—between 0.2 and 16 micrograms—of dioxin to the foreheads and backs of the incarcerated men.</p>
          <p>Just two years after the study began, Kligman reported back to Dow that he had outstanding new results. After seeing minimal change with Dow’s instructed dosage, Kligman had decided to apply 7,500 micrograms of dioxin to the skin of many participants—486 times the dosage instructed by Dow. Kligman left the men with excruciating and lasting lesions, blackheads, and blisters on their skin.</p>
          <p>Dow Chemical was shocked. They had not approved this increase in dioxin being applied to human skin. Kligman had failed to answer their research question, proving only that the minimum dosage required to elicit a reaction was somewhere between 16 and 7,500 micrograms, a massive window. To make matters worse, because of incoherent records kept by Kligman, no one could conduct follow–ups on the affected participants. Dow Chemical walked away with no answers and left 70 incarcerated men with lasting pain.</p> 
          <p>That year, Kligman became the first researcher in the history of the Food and Drug Administration to be banned from testing drugs on human subjects. The FDA cited Kligman’s sloppy work and inconsistent records in their decision. Despite this, he was reinstated a month later.</p>
          <p>In a 1980 hearing by the Environmental Protection Agency on the dioxin experiments, V. K. Rowe, the former director of Toxicological Affairs and Health and Environment Research at Dow, said that Kligman “was a professor of Dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania, and we had reasonable confidence that he would proceed in a manner consistent with our original protocol.”</p>
          <p>Rowe was wrong.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12" style="margin-top: 5rem;">
          <p>Around the same time as the Dow Chemical experiments, 320 men at Holmesburg were turned “into human guinea pigs in secret chemical warfare experiments” through a $386,486 contract between Penn and the United States Army. In these experiments, Kligman and his associate Herbert W. Copelan, another physician at Penn, were tasked with finding the MED–50, or minimum effective dose necessary to mentally disable half of any given population, for a number of mind–altering drugs. Participants were paid $12 for medical screening and up to $25 for each set of experiments they participated in. After exposure to a number of chemicals, including elements of Agent Orange and psychoactive drugs, as well as chemicals Kligman hoped would “harden” the skin, participants experienced nausea, lightheadedness, delirium, hallucinations, and anxiety. Two–thirds of the participants in the study were Black men.</p> 
          <p>However, Kligman and Copelan claimed that “no subject suffered any toxic or harmful effect.” Like the Dow Chemical records, research documents omitted the names of the men experimented on, ensuring no follow–up study could be done on the exposed. According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, a memo by a U.S. Army clinical research expert, Lt. Col. M.G. Bottiglieri, called Kligman’s medical reports “pure gibberish,” ”absolutely useless,” and “an attempt to provide a facade of competence and ability.” To this day, the University has not been able to measure the long–term effects of toxic chemical exposure on these men.</p>
          <p>For Anthony, the long–term implications of Kligman’s tests are haunting. At prison orientation, men told Anthony that he could enroll in Penn’s experiments to earn extra money. After his second test, he wanted to stop due to the painful side effects. The incentive of earning cash, however, was too much to resist.</p>
          <p>“I ain’t getting on no more tests, man,” Anthony remembers thinking after the second experiment damaged his intestines. “But sure enough, because if you don’t have no money and you want to go to movies like everybody else, you got to get movie tickets. You can get new underwear, socks, and stuff like that when you have money. And I missed that.”</p>
          <p>Anthony says he has worked odd jobs all his life but struggled to find permanent work. Now, he’s on disability benefits.</p>
          <p>“I just get enough money to live from day to day,” Anthony says. “This is a nightmare.”</p>

        <p>"Kligman designed, developed, and conducted the unethical experiments, as well as sought individual financial gain," Dober says. "If Pitt found it worth diligently deliberating on Parran's legacy, how can Penn not justify the same?"</p>
        <p>Kligman's experiments were an issue of medical ethics, but they were also, indisputably, an issue of race.</p>
        <p>In a piece published in the Inquirer, Lipoff and Adewole Adamson, a medical researcher at the University of Texas, write, "In a time when protests consistently remind us that Black lives matter, we must remember Kligman's experimental human subjects, who were mostly Black men ... were treated as if they mattered less."</p> 
        <p>The atrocities committed at Holmesburg are part of a long history of the abuse of Black bodies at the hands of medical experts. In the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study, researchers denied care to 600 Black men with syphilis, allowing the disease to destroy their lives in the name of research. Tuskegee's implications still loom large over medical practice. Today, Black women are more than three times more likely to die during childbirth than white women. Just five years ago, half of medical trainees in a research study falsely believed that Black patients felt pain at lower rates than white patients. Pain in Black people continues to go grossly under-managed in medical settings.</p>
        <p>With this enduring history of medical racism, Black Americans have grown skeptical of medical research and physicians. With the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in recent weeks, many Black people have remained distrustful of a research process that has left out people of color and fatally failed them in the past. "Holmesburg is the flip side of Tuskegee. At Tuskegee, you have sick men who were not treated," Hornblum says. "At Holmesburg, you have healthy men who were made ill."</p>
        <p>Up until recently, Kligman's name sat on classrooms, laboratories, professorships, and lectures at the University. Some of these relics to Kligman still stand, although others have been quietly removed from the University's website in recent months.</p>
        <p>When asked to comment on Kligman’s legacy, Penn offered the following statement:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 minus-half-col">
        <p>"The Perelman School of Medicine regrets the manner in which Dr. Kligman's research was conducted-which would not be acceptable by today's standards—and we are committed to upholding our responsibility to ensure the protection of participants in human subjects research. To more clearly address this complicated history, a faculty committee convened by University leadership has been working to review and make recommendations regarding Penn’s recognition of Dr. Kligman, an effort which we expect to be completed in the upcoming year."</p>
        <p>However, for many who bore witness to Kligman's legacy at Penn, this sentiment isn't enough.</p> 
        <p>"[Kligman's] controversial legacy is not widely acknowledged or recognized, even amongst people at Penn," says Lipoff. "It is really important that we honestly acknowledge our history and our historical figures for all of their great accomplishments, and for all of their flaws."</p>
        <p>Lipoff and Adamson's editorial calls for Penn to cut ties with Kligman, removing his name from all honorifics, and to "fulfill the affirmative obligation to teach about the full context of what was done."</p>
        <p>Years after his interaction with Kligman, Jim Ackerman reflects on Penn's lack of action to condemn the experiments, especially as many institutions have effectively reckoned with problematic historical figures.</p>
        <p>"It requires a certain amount of courage to tell it like it is," he says. "There was not a great show of courage among people in the medical school and the University administration."</p>
        <p>"There are medical institutions that have found out about things that were unethical and experimental in ways that were not to a patient’s advantage. They have blown the whistle, retrospectively and retroactively. Penn has had an opportunity for a long time."</p>
